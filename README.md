*name-generator* is a super simple ruby script for generating compound names from a file of words.  At this point, the script prints out all possible 2 word combinations from the list of words.  I created the script to generate possible domain names from a list of keywords.

Run the script with 1 or more filenames as arguments like so:

```
$ name-generator.rb [options] filename1 filename2 ...
```

The format of the input file(s) should be one keyword per line. The script will ignore duplicate words, even when across files.
